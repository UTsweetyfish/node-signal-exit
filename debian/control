Description: Fire an event no matter how a process exits
 When you want to fire an event no matter how a process exits:
    reaching the end of execution.
    explicitly having process.exit(code) called.
    having process.kill(pid, sig) called.
    receiving a fatal signal from outside the process
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
